II.  Finding the best hospital in a state

Instruction:  
1.  Write a function called best  best<-function(state, outcome) 
2.  Best  takes 2 arguments:   
      a. The 2 character abbreviated names of a state 
      b.  outcome name
3.  Function reads “Outcome of Care Measure.cvs”  
4.  Function returns a character vector with the name of the hospital which has the best (ie. lowest) 30- day mortality for a 
      specific outcome in each state.

HINTS
1.  The hospital name is provided in the Hospital.Name variable. 
2.  The outcome can be one of “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”
      a.  Hospital that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the ranking. 
3.  The best (ie. lowest) 30- day mortality for a specific outcome in each state.
4.  If there is a tie for the best hospital for a given outcome, 
      a. then the hospital names should be sorted in alphabetical order 
      b. And the first hospital in that set should be chosen 
(I.e. if hospitals “b”, “c”, and “f” are tied for best, then the hospital “b” should be returned)
  5.   The function must check the validity of it’s arguments
	    Example
                  a.  If an invalid “state” value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the 
                  stop function with the exact message “invalid state”.   
Example of stop function 
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/stop
       	      b.   If an invalid “outcome” value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the
                  stop function with the exact message “invalid outcome
   6.   Test your function “   Sample outputs from the function are provided.  ( see below)
   7.    Save your code for this function to a file named best.R 



Given: 
best <- function(state, outcome) { 

## Read outcome data 

## Check that state and outcome are valid 

## Return hospital name in that state with lowest 30-day death 

## rate

 }

Here is some sample output from the function. 
> source("best.R")

> best("TX", "heart attack") 
[1] "CYPRESS FAIRBANKS MEDICAL CENTER" 

> best("TX", "heart failure") 
[1] "FORT DUNCAN MEDICAL CENTER" 

> best("MD", "heart attack") 
[1] "JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL, THE" 

> best("MD", "pneumonia")
 [1] "GREATER BALTIMORE MEDICAL CENTER" 

> best("BB", "heart attack") Error in best("BB", "heart attack") : invalid state 

> best("NY", "hert attack") Error in best("NY", "hert attack") : invalid outcome
