Instruction:  
1.  Write a function called best  best<-function(state, outcome) 
2.  Best  takes 2 arguments:   
      a. The 2 character abbreviated names of a state 
      b.  outcome name
      
      We were already given the function passed to the varable best with the two arguements
      
      best<-function(state, outcome) 
 **************************************************************************************************     
      
 3.  Function reads “Outcome of Care Measure.cvs”  
     
     Data frames look like matrices, but can have columns of different types. 
     This makes them ideally suited for representing datasets, where some variables can be numeric and others can be categorical.
     
     More about how to read from a data frame please read below.
     
     https://data.princeton.edu/r/readingdata
     http://rprogramming.net/read-csv-in-r/
     
     In R, you use the read.csv() function to import data in CSV format. This function has a number of arguments, 
     but the only essential argument is file, which specifies the location and filename. 
     
     colClasses in read.cvs manually sets the data types for each column
 
      ## Read the outcome data
    data <- read.csv("outcome-of-care-measures.csv", colClasses = "character")[,c(2,7,11,17,23)]
    
*****************************************************************************************************    
     5.   The function must check the validity of it’s arguments
        
	    Example
                 a.  If an invalid “state” value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the stop function 
                 with the exact message “invalid state”.   
Example of stop function 
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.1/topics/stop
       	     b.   If an invalid “outcome” value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the 
                 stop function with the exact message “invalid outcome
     
     
     Hint 2 from directions :  The outcome can be one of “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”
     
     Look at your data files... from the print out of Hospital Compair Downloadable Database part 19.   Outcome of Care Measures.cvs
     lists.  
     We are looking for 
     "Function returns a character vector with the name of the hospital which has the best 
     (ie. lowest) 30- day mortality for a specific outcome in each state."
     Lowest 30 -day mortality rate for “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”
     numbers 11-16 is about Heart attack
     After looking at the data using head(outcome)  I see 
     hospital names under column2, State names under the 2 letter abrevation in
     in column 6, and Heart.Attack number 11 column, similarily for heartfailure column 17 and for Pneumonia column 23
     ( Now that we know that we can limit the data in our dataframe to these columns  [,c(2,7,11,17,23)] adding to )
     
     Example
     
     Hospital.30.Day.Death..Mortality..Rates.from.Heart.Attack
1                                                      14.3
2                                                      18.5
3                                                      18.1

 $ term to pull a certain value from a function (e.g. t.test(x)$p.value), 
 We know the column of outcome which contains state is called "State" by observation of the head(outcome)

      ## Check that state and outcome are valid
      
      ## If an invalid “state” value is passed to best, 
      ## the function should throw an error via the stop function with the exact message “invalid state”.
      # the state is the varible which is taken into the function therefore this tests if they are entering the correct or not
      # varibles for the function to process if not it is an error
      
      if(!any(data$State == state)) {

# Hospital that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the ranking. 
# The best (ie. lowest) 30- day mortality for a specific outcome in each state.
# If there is a tie for the best hospital for a given outcome, 
# then the hospital names should be sorted in alphabetical order 
# And the first hospital in that set should be chosen 
# I.e. if hospitals “b”, “c”, and “f” are tied for best, then the hospital “b” should be returned

Change names of columns to match outcome

colnames(data) <- c("hospital name", "state", "heart attack", "heart failure", "pneumonia")

We want to return the hospital name ( by state ) with the minimum number of heart attack ( if the outcome varible is heart attack )ect.

1.   We search the dataframe for the state and look under the outcome for that state for the min while ignoring the NA
