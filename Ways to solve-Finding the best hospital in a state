Instruction:  
1.  Write a function called best  best<-function(state, outcome) 
2.  Best  takes 2 arguments:   
      a. The 2 character abbreviated names of a state 
      b.  outcome name
      
      We were already given the function passed to the varable best with the two arguements
      
      best<-function(state, outcome) 
      
 3.  Function reads “Outcome of Care Measure.cvs”  
     
     Data frames look like matrices, but can have columns of different types. 
     This makes them ideally suited for representing datasets, where some variables can be numeric and others can be categorical.
 
      ## Read the outcome data
    dat <- read.csv("outcome-of-care-measures.csv", colClasses = "character")
