Instruction:  
1.  Write a function called best  best<-function(state, outcome) 
2.  Best  takes 2 arguments:   
      a. The 2 character abbreviated names of a state 
      b.  outcome name
      
      We were already given the function passed to the varable best with the two arguements
      
      best<-function(state, outcome) 
      
 3.  Function reads “Outcome of Care Measure.cvs”  
     
     Data frames look like matrices, but can have columns of different types. 
     This makes them ideally suited for representing datasets, where some variables can be numeric and others can be categorical.
     
     More about how to read from a data frame please read below.

     In R, you use the read.csv() function to import data in CSV format. This function has a number of arguments, 
     but the only essential argument is file, which specifies the location and filename. 
     
     colClasses in read.cvs manually sets the data types for each column
 
      ## Read the outcome data
    dat <- read.csv("outcome-of-care-measures.csv", colClasses = "character")
    
     5.   The function must check the validity of it’s arguments
        
	    Example
                 a.  If an invalid “state” value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the stop function 
                 with the exact message “invalid state”.   
Example of stop function

       	     b.   If an invalid “outcome” value is passed to best, the function should throw an error via the 
                 stop function with the exact message “invalid outcome
     
     
     Hint 2 from directions :  The outcome can be one of “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”
     
      ## Check that state and outcome are valid
