II.  Finding the best hospital in a state

Instruction:  
Write a function called best  best<-function(state, outcome) 
Best  takes 2 arguments:   
The 2 character abbreviated names of a state 
outcome name

      3.  Function reads “Outcome of Care Measure.cvs”  
      4.  Function returns a character vector with the name of the hospital which has the best (ie. lowest) 30- day mortality for a specific outcome in each state.

HINTS
 The hospital name is provided in the Hospital.Name variable. 
 The outcome can be one of “heart attack”, “heart failure”, or “pneumonia”
 Hospital that do not have data on a particular outcome should be excluded from the set of hospitals when deciding the ranking. 
The best (ie. lowest) 30- day mortality for a specific outcome in each state.
If there is a tie for the best hospital for a given outcome, 
then the hospital names should be sorted in alphabetical order 
And the first hospital in that set should be chosen 
I.e. if hospitals “b”, “c”, and “f” are tied for best, then the hospital “b” should be returned
